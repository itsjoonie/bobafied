The trademark "tiger sugar" is coined because of the tiger stripes formation on the cup due to the brown sugar syrup drips. Despite this drink being called a milk tea, it is somewhat a misnomer as it has no actual tea on it! I reckon that it is because of its association with Bubble tea, which also originated from the same country', icon="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsjoonie/Bobafied/main/image/brown-sugar-milk.jpeg")
